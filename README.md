the time series implementation in python juypter nokebook with data visualisation and modelling.
firstly,i want to tell you i didn't had worked on time series but i tried my best as you said the essence of a good devloper is aptitude to learn new thing so i tried and learned and implemented as much as i can
- i mentioned many thins in comments in code to clear my assumption and also got some errors and tried another ways to solve i wrote it there as well.

-i want to show you more work of mine i implemented model for lasso ,ridge and plolynomial regresstion as well by graidient descent approach link bellow:

- i also had done many model on classification too (these are implemented in graph lab but i can do it in sklear as well)
Thank you
